/**
 * jtag_add_dr_out() is a version of jtag_add_dr_scan() which
 * only scans data out. It operates on 32 bit integers instead
 * of 8 bit, which makes it a better impedance match with
 * the calling code which often operate on 32 bit integers.
 *
 * Current or end_state can not be TAP_RESET. end_state can be TAP_INVALID
 *
 * num_bits[i] is the number of bits to clock out from value[i] LSB first.
 *
 * If the device is in bypass, then that is an error condition in
 * the caller code that is not detected by this fn, whereas
 * jtag_add_dr_scan() does detect it. Similarly if the device is not in
 * bypass, data must be passed to it.
 *
 * If anything fails, then jtag_error will be set and jtag_execute() will
 * return an error. There is no way to determine if there was a failure
 * during this function call.
 *
 * This is an inline fn to speed up embedded hosts. Also note that
 * interface_jtag_add_dr_out() can be a *small* inline function for
 * embedded hosts.
 *
 * There is no jtag_add_dr_outin() version of this fn that also allows
 * clocking data back in. Patches gladly accepted!

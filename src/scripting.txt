Plan for hosted scripting support in OpenOCD
============================================
Jim Tcl support in OpenOCD currently exists as a patch.

There has been some discussion on the list as to what
purpose scripting support might serve in OpenOCD.

Also Lua was proposed as a scripting language, but 
only Jim Tcl has been forwarded as a patch.

Tcl is also backwards syntax compatible with OpenOCD 
commands.

Uses of scripting
=================

Default implementation of procedures in tcl/procedures.tcl.

- Polymorphic commands for target scripts.
  - produce <file> <serialnumber>. Default implementation
    is to ignore serial number and write a raw binary file
    to beginning of first flash. 
  - reset handling. Precise control of how srst, trst & 
    tms is handled and when.

/** @page thelist Pending and Open Tasks

This page lists pending and open tasks being considered or worked upon
by the OpenOCD community.


Items with a current patch available should include a link to its
posting on the openocd-developer mailing list archives.

Some items may be in progress, usually indicated by the individual whose
initials in parentheses following it.  A key for decoding these initials
appears after The List.

Most items are open for the taking, but please post to the mailing list
before spending much time working on anything lists here.  The community
may have evolved an idea since it was added here.

Feel free to send patches to add or clarify items on this list, too.

------------------------------------------------------------------
@endverbatim

- JTAG/TAP changes:
  - update all drivers to use tap_get_tms_path_len API.
    - link to posted patch: @missing
  - rework TAP state table (started but still needs work)
    - link to posted patch: @missing
  - use tap_set_state everywhere to allow logging TAP state transitions
  - rename other tap_states to use standard JTAG names (suggested by ML)
    - write script that automate production of the series of 16-17 patches
    - produce and distribute current series against the current trunk
    - distribute script so developers can use on WC through live commits
    - make live commits after giving sufficient notice to others
  - add TAP_UNKNOWN to augment TAP_INVALID? (suggested by ML/DH)
  
- JTAG Interfaces:
  - autodetect devices present on the scan chain
    - implement 'discover_taps' command

      - link to posted patch: @missing
    - fix outstanding bugs
  - J-Link driver: (ZW)
    - fix outstanding bugs
    - test with known targets (i.e. working with other interfaces)
    - test compatibility between v6.0 (yellow) and older units (e.g. v5.2)
  - TCP driver:
    - add TCP/IP client and server for remote JTAG interface control
  - Do others need some help?  Probably....

- Other Interfaces
  - SVF/XSVF:
    - pending tasks??
  - SPI/UART emulation:
    - (ab)use bit-banging JTAG interfaces to emulate SPI/UART
    - allow SPI to program flash, MCUs, etc.
  - SWD

- Target Support:
  - ARM11 improvements (MB?)
    - fix single stepping  (reported by ØH)
    - implement missing functionality (grep FNC_INFO_NOTIMPLEMENTED ...)
  - Cortex A8 support (ML)
    - add target implementation (ML)
    - what else remains to be done?
  - MC1322x support (JW/DE?)
    - integrate and test support from JW (and DE?)
    - get working with a known good interface (i.e. not today's jlink)
  - AT91SAM92xx:
    - improvements for unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg (RD)
  - STR9x: (ZW)
    - improvements to str912.cfg to be more general purpose
  - AVR: (SQ)
    - independently verify implementation
    - incrementally improve working prototype in trunk. (SQ)
    - work out how to debug this target
    - AVR debugging protocol.
  - FPGA:
    - improve things (??)
  - Coldfire (suggested by NC)
    - can we draw from the BDM project?  @par
      http://bdm.sourceforge.net/

  - other targets?  (suggestions always welcome)

    - link to patch: @missing
  - factor vendor-specific code into separate source files
  - add new callback interface for vendor-specific code
  - investigate/implement "thin wrapper" to use eCos CFI drivers (ØH)

- TCL
  - Isolate all TCL command support: 
    - Allow pure C CLI implementations using --disable-builtin-tcl
    - Allow full TCL support? add --with-tcl=/path/to/installed/tcl
    - Move TCL support in foo.* to foo_tcl.* (other ideas?)

- Debugger Support
  - Keil AGDI interface to OpenOCD (submitted by Dario Vecchio)

- Architectural Upgrades
  - Allow N:M:P mapping of servers, targets, and interfaces
  - loadable module support for interface/target/flash drivers

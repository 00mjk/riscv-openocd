/** @page tasks Pending and Open Tasks

This page lists pending and open tasks being considered or worked upon
by the OpenOCD community.

@section thelist The List

Items with a current patch available should include a link to its
posting on the openocd-developer mailing list archives.

Some items may be in progress, usually indicated by the individual whose
initials in parentheses following it.  A key for decoding these initials
appears after The List.

Most items are open for the taking, but please post to the mailing list
before spending much time working on anything lists here.  The community
may have evolved an idea since it was added here.

Feel free to send patches to add or clarify items on this list, too.

@section thelisttcl TCL

This section provides possible things to improve with OpenOCD's TCL support.

- organize the TCL configurations:
  - provide more directory structure for boards/targets?
  - factor configurations into layers (encapsulation and re-use)

- Isolate all TCL command support: 
  - Pure C CLI implementations using --disable-builtin-tcl. 
    - Allow developers to build new dongles using OpenOCD's JTAG core.
    - At first, provide only low-level JTAG support; target layer and
      above rely heavily on scripting event mechanisms.
  - Allow full TCL support? add --with-tcl=/path/to/installed/tcl
  - Move TCL support out of foo.[ch] and into foo_tcl.[ch] (other ideas?)

@section thelistjtag JTAG

This section list issues that need to be resolved in the JTAG layer.

@subsection thelistjtagcore JTAG Core

The following tasks have been suggeted for cleaning up the JTAG layer:

- use tap_set_state everywhere to allow logging TAP state transitions
- rename other tap_states to use standard JTAG names (suggested by ML)
- retire jtag_add_end_state() and replace w/global variable:
  - removes TAP_INVALID as an argument to jtag_add_xxxx().
  - global variable as argument to jtag_add_xxxx() should be phased out, but
    it is useful while we need to bug-by-bug compatible while testing changes.
 - Suggested by ØH. Michael Bruck also interested in this.
- Encapsulate cmd_queue_cur_state and related varaible handling.

The following tasks have been suggested for adding new core JTAG support:

- autodetect devices present on the scan chain
  - implement 'discover_taps' command
- SPI/UART emulation:
  - (ab)use bit-banging JTAG interfaces to emulate SPI/UART
  - allow SPI to program flash, MCUs, etc.

@subsection thelistjtaginterfaces JTAG Interfaces

The following tasks have been suggeted for improving OpenOCD's JTAG
interface support:

- rework USB communication to be more robust.  Two possible options are:
  -# use libusb-1.0.1 with libusb-compat-0.1.1 (non-blocking I/O wrapper)
  -# rewrite implementation to use non-blocking I/O
- FT2232 driver:
  - integrate FTD2XX High-Speed Device support @par
      PATCH: https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-April/005479.html
  - fix outstanding bugs
- J-Link driver:
  - fix to work with long scan chains, such as R.Doss's svf test.
  - fix other outstanding bugs

The following tasks have been suggested for adding new JTAG interfaces:

- TCP driver: allow client/server for remote JTAG interface control.

@section thelistswd Serial Wire Debug

- implement Serial Wire Debug interface 

@section thelistbs Boundary Scan Support

- add STAPL support?
- add BSDL support?

A few possible options for the above:
  -# Fake a TCL equivalent?
  -# Integrate an existing library?
  -# Write a new C implementation a la Jim?

Once the above are completed:
- add support for programming flash using boundary scan techniques
- add integration with a modified gerber view program:
  - provide means to view the PCB and select pins and traces
  - allow use-cases such as the following:
    - @b Stimulus
      -# Double-click on a pin (or trace) with the mouse.
    - @b Effects
      -# The trace starts blinking, and
      -# OpenOCD toggles the pin(s) 0/1.

@section thelisttargets Target Support

- AT91SAM92xx:
  - improvements for unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg (RD)
- STR9x: (ZW)
  - improvements to str912.cfg to be more general purpose
- AVR: (SQ)
  - independently verify implementation
  - incrementally improve working prototype in trunk. (SQ)
  - work out how to debug this target
  - AVR debugging protocol.

    http://bdm.sourceforge.net/

    or the OSBDM package @par
    http://forums.freescale.com/freescale/board/message?board.id=OSBDM08&thread.id=422

@section thelistsvf SVF/XSVF

- factor and clean-up code

  - provide Technical Primers to bootstrap contributor knowledge
- develop SVF unit tests 
- develop XSVF unit tests 

@section thelistflash Flash Support

- finish documentation for the following flash drivers:
  - avr
  - ecosflash
  - pic32mx
  - ocl
  - str9xpec

@subsection thelistflashcfi CFI

@section thelisttesting Testing Suite

This section includes several related groups of ideas:
- @ref thelistunittests
- @ref thelistsmoketests
- @ref thelisttestreports
- @ref thelisttestgenerichw

@subsection thelistunittests Unit Tests

- add testing skeleton to provide frameworks for adding tests
- implement server unit tests
- implement JTAG core unit tests
- implement JTAG interface unit tests
- implement flash unit tests
- implement target unit tests

@subsection thelistsmoketests Smoke Test Tools

-# extend 'make check' with a smoketest app
  - checks for OOCD_TEST_CONFIG, etc. in environment (or config file)
  - if properly set, runs the smoke test with specified parameters
    - openocd -f ${OOCD_TEST_CONFIG}
    - implies a modular test suite (see below)
  - should be able to run some minimal tests with dummy interface:
    - compare results of baseline sanity checks with expected results

-# builds a more complete test suite:
  - existing testing/examples/ look like a great start
  - all targets should be tested fully and for all capabilities
    - we do NOT want a "lowest common denominator" test suite
    - ... but can we start with one to get going?
  - probably requires one test configuration file per board/target
    - modularization can occur here, just like with targets/boards/chips
    - coverage can increase over time, building up bundles of tests

-# add new 'smoketest' Makefile target:
  - calls 'make check' (and the smoketest app)
  - gather inputs and output into a report file

@subsection thelisttestreports Test Feedback Tools

These ideas were first introduced here:
  https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-May/006358.html

- provide report submission scripts for e-mail and web forms
- add new Makefile targets to post the report:
  - 'checkreportsend' -- send to list via e-mail (via sendmail)
  - 'checkreportpost' -- send web form (via curl or other script)

@subsection thelisttestgenerichw Generic Hardware Tester

- implement VHDL to use for FPGA-based JTAG TAP testing device
- develop test suite that utilizes this testing device

@section thelistautotools Autotools Build System

- investigate fixes to permit the use of -Wshadow
- eliminate sources of confusion in @c boostrap script:
  -# Make @c bootstrap call 'configure --enable-maintainer-mode <opts>'?
  -# Add @c buildstrap script to assist with boostrap and configure steps.
- automatically build tool-chains required for cross-compiling
  - produce mingw32, arm-elf, others using in-tree scripts
  - build all required target code from sources
- make JTAG and USB debug output a run-time configuration option

@section thelistarchitecture Architectural Tasks

The following architectural tasks need to be accomplished and should be
fairly easy to complete:

- factor code to eliminate duplicated functionality
- overhaul use of types to improve 32/64-bit portability
- rewrite code that uses casts to access 16-bit and larger types
  from unaligned memory addresses
- libopenocd support: @par
    https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-May/006405.html
- review and clean up interface/target/flash APIs 

The following strategic tasks will require ambition, knowledge, and time
to complete:

- Allow N:M:P mapping of servers, targets, and interfaces
- loadable module support for interface/target/flash drivers

@section thelistadmin Administrative Tasks

- Develop "style" guidelines for committing to Subversion
- Develop milestone and release guidelines.

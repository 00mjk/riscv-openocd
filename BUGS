/** @page bugs Bug Reporting

Please report bugs by subscribing to the OpenOCD mailing list and
posting a message with your report:

	openocd-development@lists.berlios.de

To minimize work for OpenOCD developers, you should try to include
all of the information listed below.  If you feel that some of the
items below are unnecessary for a clear bug report, you may leave
them out; likewise, feel free to include additional information
that may be important.

- Target PCB/board description
- Configuration scripts
- OpenOCD command line
- List of commands issued or GDB operations performed
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Logs using <code>debug_level 3</code> (or with '-d 3' on the command line)
- If the report is for a regression:
  - Include logs for both working and broken versions.
  - Find the precise version that caused the regression by binary search.
    For example: if testing version 550 works but 600 fail, then try 575, etc.

If possible, please develop and attach a patch that helps to expose or
solve the reported problem.  See the PATCHES file for more information
for that process.

Attach all files directly to your posting.  The mailing list knows to
transform attachments to links, but attachments must be less than 300KB
in total.

@section bugscrashdump Obtaining Crash Backtraces

If OpenOCD is crashing, you can use GDB to get a trace:@par
@code
% gdb --args openocd ....
(gdb) run
(gdb) bt
=> here a stack trace is dumped.
@endcode

@section bugsintreedebug Running and Debugging In-Tree

To run or debug the in-tree executable (not recommended), you must
use libtool to set up the correct shared library paths:
@code
  libtool gdb --args openocd ....
@endcode
or the more pedantic (and forward-compatible):
@code
  libtool --mode=execute gdb --args openocd ....
@endcode

/** @page bugs Bug Reporting

Please report bugs by subscribing to the OpenOCD mailing list and
posting a message with your report:

	openocd-development@lists.berlios.de

To minimize work for OpenOCD developers, you can include
all the information below.  If you feel that some of the
items below are unnecessary for a clear bug report, you
leave them out.

- Target PCB/board description
- Config scripts
- OpenOCD command line
- List of commands issued or GDB operations performed
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Logs using @c debug_level 3 (e.g. add '-d 3' to the command line)
- If this is a regression, include logs for working and broken version
- If this is a regression, please find out the precise version that
  caused the regression.  This can be done via a binary search; For
  example: if testing version 550 works but 600 fail, then try 575, etc.

- If OpenOCD is crashing, you can use GDB to get a trace:@par
@code
% gdb --args openocd ....
(gdb) run
(gdb) bt
=> here a stack trace is dumped.
@endcode

- To run or debug the in-tree executable (not recommended), you must
  use libtool to set up the correct shared library paths:
@code
  libtool gdb --args openocd ....
@endcode
or the more pedantic (and forward-compatible):
@code
  libtool --mode=execute gdb --args openocd ....
@endcode
- Attach files directly to the posting.  The mailing list knows to
transform attachments to links so you will not be bloating anyones mail
box.  Please keep attachments to less than 100KB.

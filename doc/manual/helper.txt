/** @page helperdocs OpenOCD Helper APIs

OpenOCD uses several low-level APIs as the foundation for high-level APIs:

  - @subpage helperporting
  - @subpage helperjim
  - @subpage helpercommand
  - @subpage helperlogging
  - @subpage helperbuffers

This section needs to be expanded.

/** @page helperjim OpenOCD Jim API

The Jim API provides access to a small-footprint TCL implementation.

/** @page helpercommand OpenOCD Command API

OpenOCD's command API allows modules to register callbacks that are then
available to the scripting services.  It provides the mechanism for
these commands to be dispatched to the modlue using a standard
interfaces.  It provides macros for defining functions that use and
extend this interface.

@section helpercmdhandler Command Handlers

Command handlers are functions with a particular signature, which can
be extended by modules for passing additional parameters to helpers or
another layer of handlers.

@subsection helpercmdhandlerdef Defining and Calling Command Handlers

These functions should be defined using the @c COMMAND_HANDLER macro.
These methods must be defined as static, as their principle entry point
should be the run_command dispatch mechanism.

Command helper functions that require access to the full set of
parameters should be defined using the @c COMMAND_HELPER.  These must be
declared static by you, as sometimes you might want to share a helper
among several files (e.g. @c s3c24xx_nand.h).

Both types of routines must be called using the @c CALL_COMMAND_HANDLER macro.
Calls using this macro to normal handlers require the name of the command
handler (which can a name or function pointer).  Calls to helpers and
derived handlers must pass those extra parameters specified by their
definitions; however, lexical capture is used for the core parameters.
This dirty trick is being used as a stop-gap measure while the API is
migrated to one that passes a pointer to a structure containing the
same ingredients.  At that point, this macro will be removed and callers
will be able to use direct invocations.

Thus, the following macros can be used to define and call command
handlers or helpers:

- @c COMMAND_HANDLER - declare or define a command handler.
- @c COMMAND_HELPER - declare or define a derived command handler or helper.
- @c CALL_COMMAND_COMMAND - call a command handler/helper.

@subsection helpercmdhandlermacros Command Handler Macros

In addition, the following macros may be used in the context of
command handlers and helpers:
- @c CMD_CTX - the current @c command_context
- @c CMD_NAME - invoked command name
- @c CMD_ARGC - the number of command arguments
- @c CMD_ARGV - array of command argument strings

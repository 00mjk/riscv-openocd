/** @page oocd OpenOCD Architecture

The OpenOCD library consists of several APIs that build together to
provide the support functionality.  The following list shows how these
modules are stacked in the current implementation (from bottom to top):

- @subpage helperdocs
  - @ref helperporting
  - @ref helperjim
  - @ref helpercommand
  - @ref helperlogging
- @subpage jtagdocs
  - @ref jtagcable
  - @ref jtagtap
  - @ref jtagmdriver
  - @ref jtagdriver
- @subpage targetdocs
  - @ref targetarm
  - @ref targetnotarm
  - @ref targetregister
  - @ref targetimage
  - @ref targettrace
- @subpage flashdocs
  - @ref flashcfi
  - @ref flashnand
  - @ref flashtarget
- @subpage serverdocs
  - @ref servergdb
  - @ref servertelnet
  - @ref serverhttp
- @subpage appdocs

Obviously, there are some nuances to the stack that are not shown by
this linear list of layers.

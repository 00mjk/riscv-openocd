Please mail patches to:

openocd-development@lists.berlios.de

Note that you can't send patches to that list unless
you're a member, despite what the list info page says.

The patch should be against svn trunk using an SVN
diff. 

Attach the patch to the email as a .txt file and
also write a short change log entry that maintainers
can copy and paste into the commit message

(However, don't expect the maintainers to actually
include such entries in their commit messages if
they're longer than a single $SUBJECT line.)

Add yourself to the GPL copyright for non-trivial changes.

To create a patch from the command line:
 
svn diff >mypatch.txt

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re09.html

NB! remember to use "svn add" on new files first!

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re01.html



If you have a decent SVN GUI, then that should be
able to create and apply patches as well...
